pwd- present working directory
cd  - change directory
ls finding hidden folders with ls - list files and folder
mkdir rmdir - make and remove directory
cp rm mv locate - copy remove moving and locate files
updatedb - updates database to make it easier looking for files files
passwd - change password
man


cd to go up a folder u are not in  cd / press tab to se the folders up the tree cd /ete/ double tab to see files in that folder of ls /ete/


instead of cd root/desktop/music/   cd ~/music/ used in root folders 


cd D presed tab not working double tab to see contents



ls -la looks for hidden folders



man and command to show how to use the command e.g. man ls





second session 

overview 
chmod - change mode this l.ets us change permissions on a file or direcotry
adduser
/etc/passwd, /etc/shadow - etc passwd what users are on the machine etc shadow passwords stored in hashes
su - switch user
sudo - elevate user 




directories 

-rw-----  when we se a hyphen first it is a file
drwx--- when we se a d first it is a direcotry the rwx is the permission settings read wirte and exeute

drwxr-x-xr-x the direcotry has 3 groups the first is the owner had rwx second is the members of the group xr and third all users can only x

chmod is used to change perm e.g.. chmod +x(name of permision execute is x) helo.txt or chmod 777 hello.txt to give full access

in pent testing we look for files with read write execute to be able to modify for our benefits

adduser - adduser spencer to add user spencer


cat /etc/passwd  - to show list of users 

cat /etc/shadow

su prince - switch user to prince


passwd prince - change prince password




third session

common networking commands

ifconfig - show iur interface types and ip associated with them and inet netmask and broadcast and lo address associated with them
iwconfig - wireless adapter version
ping -  ping to see if a machine is alive and responding to us e.g. ping 192.168.15.1 
arp - mask ip address and mac addreses the arp -a ip address it talks to and ip and mac address associiated with it
netstat - command line tool to display connection and listening port thiis shows the  netstat -ano shows active connection running on the machine
route - display our routing table and tells us where our trafic exit

fourth session 
view create and edit files
echo - echos wat u type  echo “fdsf” or to wirite to a text echo '"fdsf" > new.txt
cat - print out a doc 
replace vs appending (> vs >>) echo “fdsf” > dsfs.txt for replacing and echo ‘fdsf’ >> sdsdf.txt to append
touch create a file touch new.txt
nano text editor for terminal nano new.txt u can use vi or vim
gedit gui text editor  gedit new.txt

fourth session 

starting and stopping services

services -   deals with services start or stop services dbase webserver or ssh e.g. service apache2 start or stop. service nameofservice start or stop
systemctl - allows us to enable or disable on boot  systemctl enable postgresql to make postgresql start on boot

spin up a python webserver : python -m SimpleHTTPServer and add the port num to local web address to upload it gui


fifth session

updating and installing tools
installing updates with apt-get
intalling tools with apt-get 
using git


to update and upgrade system 
apt-get update && apt-get upgrade - look thorugh packages and check for update upgrade to the system


to install 
apt-get install appname 


to accept yes on all 
apt-get install appname -y


to install from git
git clone  link
see install instructions from git or use apt get to install if it is available



last lesson 
scripting with bash

grep - allows us to narow down resuls 
to filter with grep we use pipe  to add the command  
cat ip.txt | grep “64 bytes” 
this is to get all lines with 64 bytes
| this symbol is to add a new command

cut - same
cat ip.txt | grep “64 bytes”  | cut -d “ ”  -f  4

-d is a delimiter this is what we are going to be cutting on 
-f is field in this we specified field four in this case seprated by the space the ip address is the fourth field
64 bytes from 10.0.2.15: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.025 ms


tr - same
cat ip.txt | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":"
tr is to remove in this case the colon : is what is removed and -d is delimeter

script writing
for loops

scripting in file called ipsweep.sh
#!/bin/bash - this declares the type wheather python or bash
 
 
if [ '$1' == ' '] --if statement runs when ip address is none
then
echo "You forgot an IP address!"
echo "Syntax: ./ipsweep.sh 192.168.1"

else
for ip in `seq 1 254` ; do  -- for this in 1 to 254 do something
ping -c 1 $1.$ip | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" &    -- the dollar sign is  userinput in this the ip  the and sign is for threading else u have to replace with semi colon
done

fi --this is end if


to run it type 
./ipsweep.sh

to add the ip address swept to list
./ipsweep.sh 192.168..1 > iplist.txt

send packets to ping
ping ipaddress -c 1 e.g. number is the number of packets u want in this case 1
if respose u 64bytes if no response 0bytes







#!/bin/bash 
if [ '$1' == '' ]
then
echo "You forgot an IP address!"
echo "Syntax: ./ipsweep.sh 192.168.1"

else
for ip in `seq 1 10` ; do
ping -c 1 $1 | grep "64 bytes" | cut -d " " -f 4 | tr -d ":" &
done
fi


using for loop oneliners
for ip in $(cat iplist.txt); do nmap -sS -p 80 -T4 $ip & done
for loop in ip list do nmap -sS is stealth speed -p port -T4 is speed




whoami - tell u the current user logedin 
date - tells u date
history - list of previous executed commands 

cp 1.txt 2.txt - copy contents of 1.txt to 2.txt

mv 1.txt 2.txt - move contents of 1.txt to 2.txt

to set variable local variable= hello=90
to make global variable - export hello
echo $hello - to print value 


unset hello - to remove value already set

chmod u-x 1.txt = to remove permissions 
why we had to use 777 in chmod 4 means read 2 write permission 1 means execute permission
thats why its 7

chown is to change ownership 
chown username 1.txt - change ownership of file for user
chown spl 1.txt


chgrp groupname filename - change ownership of file for group 


chown username:groupname filename both user and group at the same time


to change for user group others
chmod u+x filename 
chmod g-x filename 
chmod o-x filename

same as chmod u for username g for group o for others

find groups in  /etc/group/
create group - groupadd dev


display cntent in file 
head first 10lines
tail last 10 lines 
grep search for pattern
cat entire content is displayed


searches a file or dirctory  to show direcotry and subfiles in the directory - find Downloads
file - shows type of file
e.g. file Downloads

initalizing a process 
in the background and fore ground  
when run by default is in the foreground 
to make it bakground 
pwd & 



ps - lists outs all running process 
ps- aux   =list out all the running processes for all users
ps -u username = show all processes under user

the 5 process in linux

initializing a process
tracking a process
stopping a process
other processes


ps data 

uid user id or id of the useer running the process
pid process id 
ppid parent process id 
c cpu utilization of process
tty terminal type associated with the process
time cpu time taken by the process 
cmd th command that started this process



stop a process

to stop a foreground app  = ctrl + c 
to stop a background app = kill[term sig][pid]

kill -9 12322 = to kill the app -9 is terminate the process



kill -l shows all signals in the linux


other processes 
top  = to see all the running processes within the working env of liinux

nice [-nice value] [process]=to start a process and assign its priority value (nice value) at the same time 
nice values range from -20 to 19 where -20 is the highest

e.g. nice --19 cat for a negetive value and nice -19 cat = the fiirst is priority level -19 and other is priority 19 


renice [-nice vlaue] [processi id] to change the priority of a process

e.g. renice -3 11988


df = used to list the amount of available and used disk space by a file system




python script
a fuzzing script

#!/usr/bin/python 
import sys, socket
from time import sleep

buffer = "A" * 100   - just a string of a hundred a's

while True:
          try:
              s= socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) - send a connection
              s.connect(('192.168.1.1', 9999)) - ipv4address, and port 
              s.send(('TRUN /.:/' + buffer)) - sending the Trun message plus 100 a
              s.close()
              sleep(1) -sleep for a second
              buffer= buffer + 'A'*100
           except: 
                 print 'Fuzzing crashed at %s bytes' %(str(len(buffer))
                 sys.exit()
